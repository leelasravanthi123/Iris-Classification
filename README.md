# Iris-Classification

The Iris Classification problem involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It's a classic machine learning problem often used for introductory purposes due to its simplicity yet effectiveness in understanding various classification algorithms.

The dataset contains measurements from three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Classification Algorithms:
Several machine learning algorithms can be applied to classify iris flowers based on these measurements:
Decision Trees: They partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on simple rules inferred from the data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This algorithm classifies data points based on the majority class among their K nearest neighbors.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVMs create a hyperplane that separates different classes by maximizing the margin between them.

Logistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks and can be extended for multi-class problems like the Iris dataset using strategies like one-vs-rest.

Process of Classification:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features for uniformity.
Splitting Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Model Training: Using the training data to train the classification models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting model parameters to optimize performance.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
